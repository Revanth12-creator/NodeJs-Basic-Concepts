Nowadays heart stroke cases are increased because people are not taking care abouttheir healthy habits, and food.
They are getting heart stroke in the early age.Rajesh, N., T, M., Hafeez, S., & Krishna, H.
 (2018) are utilized Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to predict the heart disease. 
 This is only effective when the dataset is small.
 It failed to give accurate result when we train the model using large dataset. 
 I am implementing a web application that can predict the person is having the chances of getting heartstroke.
 To implement this project I am taking a real time dataset related to heart stroke that is available publicly inwebsites.
 I will analyze and apply machine learning techniques on the heart stroke dataset to give the accurate prediction about occurrence of heart stroke. 
 This project will help the people reduce the chances of happening heart strokes.
